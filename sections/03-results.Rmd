## Analaysis

- no randomisation due to supply shortage
- on ICU only Arrow/Braun CVCs placed
- in the OR Arrow/Braun/Vygon CVCs
- all 4 lumens excluded (just Arrow ARROWgard blue, special coating, no competitor, no comparison against Arrow 3 or 5 lumens due to differences in coating)
- Braun 5 lumens exclude due to small sample size and large diameter (high-flow catheter)
- Site: FV excluded because of small sample size
- Site: SCV excluded because of difficult ultrasound assessment
- AnticoagulationGroup: DOAC excluded because of small sample size
- consecutive CVC excluded, not independent, may thrombosis caused by patient-intrinsic factors, seen (but not shown), if there was a thrombosis the next catheter is more likely to get a thrombosis as well
- nearly half the screened CVCs excluded
- divided in four groups, comparison Arrow 3 lumens vs Braun 3 lumens and Arrow 5 lumens vs Vygon 5 lumens
- 3 lumens: no diff Arrow vs Braun, ca. 50 % CRT on day 1
- 5 lumens: diff Arrow vs Vygon, ca 40 vs 65 % CRT on day 1
- multiple regression with all 106 analysed CVCs, (some 7 excluded due to missing BMI)
- complications: 1 CLABSI, 1 PE (but thrombosis elsewhere)
