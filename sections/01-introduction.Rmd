# Introduction

- Central venous catheters (CVC) commonly used in surgery and ICU
- Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) are major complications/risk factors for PE/bloodstream infections
- Incidence varies widely (6 - 56 %) medical vs surgical patients
- No screening: time to CRT unknown, except study Wu et al 2023 in medical critical ill patients: median time 4 days ~ 17 % CRT
- Incidence in surgical patients higher, time to onset not investigated
- No information about different manufacturers of CVCs
- Therefore, we designed a prospective single center study to detect the onset of CRT and its dependency on the material or manufacturer of the CVCs in critical ill surgical patients.
