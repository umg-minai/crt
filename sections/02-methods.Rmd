# Methods

## Study design and population

In this prospective single-center observational study we screened
critical ill patients with CVCs for CRT
in or admitted to our surgical intensive care unit (ICU)
in a six-month period, March 2022 to August 2022.

We enrolled all consecutive adult patients (&le; 18 years) who required a CVC for 48 h or longer.
All CVCs were placed in the operation theatre or ICU using an ultrasound-guided insertion approach and maximum barrier precautions according to local guidelines.
Skin antiseptis was performed with octenidine dihydrochlordie, 1-propanol, 2-propanol (octeniderm colourless, Sch√ºlke & Mayr GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany).
The choice of the appropriate CVC and location was made by the clinicians.
They were asked to complete a questionnare and document the manufacturer, the LOT (identification) number, the number of attempts, complications and their expertise.
If the patient had a blood sample taken on day of screening we ordered white blood cells (WBC), C-related peptide (CRP) and D-dimer.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Medicine Greifswald
(reference number: BB 006/22).

## Ultrasound assessment

CVCs were ultrasound scanned for CRT every other days, starting within 24 hours of placement. examined for CRT by ultrasound on every second day, starting within 24 hours after placement.
We used a linear probe with a frequency of 8-12 MHz.
All patients were examined in the supine position.
A CRT was diagnosed when an echogenic structure attached to the CVC was detected that was non-compressible and showed a pathological color Doppler.
To determine the size of the thrombosis we measured the largest dimension (height) in short-axis and the longest one (length) in the long-axis view.
A picture or video was taken if there was an obvious change in size or if a thrombosis was found for the first time.
We didn't look at arterial catheters or catheters for renal replacement or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy.
To ensure consistent and high image quality the ultrasound examination was always performed by one of the authors (SE),
who was trained in point-of-care ultrasound and intensive care medicine and had more than two years experience.
The recorded images and videos were then reviewed by a second independent intensivist (SG) with more than seven years experience in point-of-care ultrasound.
Neither was involved in placing the CVCs or treating the critical ill patients.
The findings were not reported to the treating clinicians.

## Catheter types

Due to supply shortage a controlled randomisation was not feasible and various types of CVCs of different manufacturer were used.
We observed three different types of Arrow CVCs (Teleflex Medical GmbH, Germany), namely the classic polyurethane CVCs with three and five lumens (referred as Arrow3 and Arrow5), and the chlorhexidine acetate and silver sulfadiazine coated polyurethane catheters ARROWgard Blue (1st generation) with 4 lumens (referred as Arrow4).
The three lumen Certofix protect trio (B. Braun SE, Germany) was made of a silikonized polyurethane, an embedded contrast medium barium sulfate and coated with
antiseptic polyhexamethylene biguanide (polyhexanide; referred as Braun3).
The five lumen multicath CVC (VYGON GmbH & Co. KG, Germany; referred as Vygon5) were made of polyurethane without any special coating.

## Outcome

The primary outcome was the time of onset of CRT for each type of CVC.
As the reported CRT rates were very inhomogeneous, we planned an
observational study over a six-month period and didn't estimate a sample size.
Secondary outcomes were (1) difference between CRT-free time according to the type
of CVC and (2) risk factors for CRT.

## Statistical analysis

All data processing and statistical analyses were performed using R version
`r paste0(sessionInfo()$R.version[c("major", "minor")], collapse = ".")`
[@R-base].

Prior to the analyses, all laboratory values were *log* transformed to
approximate a normal distribution.
CRT-free time was modelled using Kaplan-Meier estimates and comparison between different CVC types was done by applying the Gehan-Wilcoxon test with the Peto and Peto modification for different censoring patterns as implemented in the *survival* R package [@survival-book; @R-survival].
Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios, as provided by the *survival* R package [@Cox1972; @survival-book; @R-survival].
A $p$-value less than 0.05 was considered a statistical significant difference.
Multiple testing was corrected apply the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [@Benjamini1995].
Summary tables, the CONSORT and the forest plots were generated using the *gtsummary*, *consort*, and *survminer* package, respectively
[@gtsummary; @R-gtsummary; @R-consort; @R-survminer].
