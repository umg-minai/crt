# Methods

## Study design and population

In this prospective single-center observational study we assessed
critically ill patients with CVCs for CRT
in or admitted to our surgical intensive care unit (ICU)
during a six-month period from March 2022 to August 2022.

We enrolled all consecutive adult patients (&ge; 18 years) who required a CVC for at least 48 hours.
All CVCs were placed in the operating theatre or ICU using an ultrasound-guided insertion approach and maximum barrier precautions according to local guidelines.
Skin antisepsis was performed with octenidine dihydrochlordie, 1-propanol, 2-propanol (octeniderm colourless, Sch√ºlke & Mayr GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany).
The choice of the appropriate CVC and side was made by the clinicians.
They were asked to complete a questionnaire documenting the manufacturer, the LOT (identification) number, the number of attempts, complications and their expertise.
If the patient had a blood sample taken on the day of screening we ordered white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive peptide (CRP) and D-dimer.

The study was approved by the ethics committee of the University Medicine Greifswald
(reference number: BB 006/22).

## Ultrasound assessment

CVCs were ultrasound scanned for CRT every other day, starting within 24 hours of placement.
We used a linear probe with a frequency of 8-12 MHz.
All patients were examined in the supine position.
CRT was diagnosed when an echogenic structure attached to the CVC was detected which was non-compressible and showed pathological color Doppler.
To determine the size of the thrombosis, we measured the largest dimension (height) in short-axis and the longest dimension (length) in the long-axis view.
A picture or video was taken if there was an obvious change in size or if a thrombosis was found for the first time.
We didn't look at arterial catheters or catheters for renal replacement or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy.
To ensure consistent and high image quality the ultrasound examination was always performed by one of the authors (SE),
who was trained in point-of-care ultrasound and intensive care medicine and had more than two years' experience.
The recorded images and videos were then reviewed by a second independent intensivist (SG) with more than seven years' experience in point-of-care ultrasound.
Neither was involved in the placement of CVCs or the management of the critically ill patients.
The findings were not reported to the treating clinicians.

## Catheter types

Due to supply constraints, controlled randomisation was not feasible and different types of CVCs from different manufactures were used.
We observed three different types of Arrow CVCs (Teleflex Medical GmbH, Germany), namely the classic polyurethane CVCs with three and five lumens (referred as Arrow3 and Arrow5), and the chlorhexidine acetate and silver sulfadiazine coated polyurethane catheters ARROWgard Blue (1st generation) with four lumens (referred as Arrow4).
The three-lumen Certofix protect trio (B. Braun SE, Germany) consisted of a siliconized polyurethane, embedded barium sulfate contrast agent and an
antiseptic polyhexamethylene biguanide coating (polyhexanide; referred as Braun3).
The five-lumen multicath CVC (VYGON GmbH & Co. KG, Germany; referred as Vygon5) was made of polyurethane without any special coating.

## Outcome

The primary outcome was the time of onset of CRT for each type of CVC.
As the reported CRT rates were very inhomogeneous, we planned an
observational study over a six-month period and did not estimate a sample size.
Secondary outcomes were (1) difference in CRT-free time according to the type
of CVC and (2) risk factors for CRT.

## Statistical analysis

All data processing and statistical analyses were performed using R version
`r paste0(sessionInfo()$R.version[c("major", "minor")], collapse = ".")`
[@R-base].

Prior to the analyses, all laboratory values were *log* transformed to
approximate a normal distribution.
CRT-free time was modelled using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and comparisons between different CVC types were made using the Gehan-Wilcoxon test with the Peto and Peto modification for different censoring patterns as implemented in the *survival* R package [@survival-book; @R-survival].
Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios, as provided by the *survival* R package [@Cox1972; @survival-book; @R-survival].
A $p$-value less than 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference.
Multiple testing was corrected apply the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [@Benjamini1995].
Summary tables, the CONSORT and the forest plots were generated using the *gtsummary*, *consort*, and *survminer* package, respectively
[@gtsummary; @R-gtsummary; @R-consort; @R-survminer].
