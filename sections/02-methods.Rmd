# Methods

## Study design and population

- prospective singlecenter observational study
- criticall ill patients, surgical ICU
- six month period, March 2022 to August 2022
- enrolled consecutive adult patients with a CVC on our ICU

- CVCs placed with ultrasound in the OR or on the ICU
- documented: manufacturer, serial number, lumens, site, side, number of attempts, complications, expertise
- additional laboratory values (WBC, CRP, DDimer) at every screening day

The Ethics Committee at the University Medicine Greifswald
approved this study (reference number: B006/22).

## Ultrasound assessment

- No screening of arterial catheters or catheters for renal replacement or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy
- Screening every second day, starting within 24 hours after placement
- linear probe 8-12 MHz
- examination performed by one of the authors (SE), independent (not involved in placement of the CVCs or treatment of the patients), trained in point-of-care ultrasound
- patients examined in the supine position
- images were recorded if thrombosis detected and/or it size changed in short- and long-axis view
- images were reviewed by second intensivist (SG)
- CRT was diagnosed if an echogenic structure attached to the CVC was detected that is non-compressible and showed an pathological (gap in the) color doppler image
- thrombosis size was measured by the largest diameter in short-axis and longest lenght in long-axis
- findings not communicated to the treating clinicians

## Catheter types (TODO: Sebastian Engelhardt)

- Braun: TODO: certofix trio and quinto
- Vygon: multicath up 5
- Arrow: CVC 3 and 5 lumens, CVC ARROWgard blue (1st generation; chlorhexidine acetate and silver sulfadiazine) 4 lumens

## Electron microscopic images (TODO: Sebastian Engelhardt)

- unused CVCs: Braun certofix trio, Arrow CVC 3, Vygon multicath up 5 and Arrow 5 CVC
- no information, TODO: Sebastian Engelhardt

## Statistical analysis

- analysis in R, using survival package, summary tables gtsummary
- log transformation of lab values, approximate normal distribution
- CRT free time modelled using Kaplan-Meier estimate
- (univariate) Comparison between different manufacturer Gehan-Wilcoxon test, p < 0.05 sign.
- multiple regression to estimate hazard ratios for different variables
