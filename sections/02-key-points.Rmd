# Key points

## Question

This study investigates the incidence of catheter-related thrombosis and its
dependence on catheter material and/or type in surgical critically ill patients.

## Findings

In this prospective observational single-center study we examined 95 first-time
central venous catheters (CVC) in the internal jugular vein for catheter-related
thrombosis using ultrasound.
Depending on the type of CVC, within one day, 37 to 64% of CVCs and within one
week, 64 to 100% of CVCs developed a thrombosis.

## Meaning

Almost all CVCs in critically ill surgical patients developed an asymptomatic
CRT in the first days after catheterization.
