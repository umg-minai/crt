## Author Contributions

```{r author-contributions, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
.drop_author_title <- function(x)gsub(",.*$", "", x)

authors <- unlist(rmarkdown::metadata$author, recursive = FALSE)
roles <- lapply(authors, "[[", "role")
nn <- lengths(roles)
ctbs <- data.frame(
    author = rep(names(roles), nn),
    contribution = unlist(roles),
    row.names = seq_len(sum(nn))
)
ctbs <- ctbs[order(ctbs$contribution, ctbs$author),]
l <- split(.drop_author_title(ctbs$author), ctbs$contribution)
nms <- names(l)
actbs <- character(length(l))
## lapply/mapply is not working with .cli_text, even `force` doesn't help
for (i in seq_along(l)) {
    nm <- nms[i]
    txt <- l[[i]]
    actbs[i] <- paste0(nm, ": ", .cli_text("{txt}"), collapse = "; ")
}
cat(
    paste(actbs, collapse = "; "),
    "All authors have read and agreed to the published version",
    "of the manuscript."
)
```

## Competing interests

```{r competing-interests, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cois <- vapply(authors, "[[", "competing_interest", FUN.VALUE = NA_character_)

names(cois) <- .drop_author_title(names(cois))
is_none <- cois == "none"

if (all(is_none)) {
    cat("All authors state no conflict of interest.")
} else if (all(!is_none)) {
    cat(paste(names(cois), cois))
} else {
    cat(
        paste(names(cois)[!is_none], cois[!is_none]),
        "All other authors state no conflict of interest."
    )
}
```
