# Discussion

TODO: find material of CVCs, may ask manufacturers

- incidence higher than previously reported, especially in comparison to medical critical ill patients
- most CRT already on first day (just a few hours after placement) -> chose indication wisely
- difference between manufacturers
-
- no communication to clinicians, CRT without treatment didn't yield negative outcome
- guidelines suggest catheter removal, no negative outcome, unnecessary, following CVC with CRT in a few hours, even under anticoagulation, additional vessel with thrombosis, conclusion just leave in place if no critical symptom (intracranial edema, CLABSI, ...)


## Limitations

- nearly half excluded, resulting in a small sample size
- no randomisation due to supply shortage
- on ICU just Arrow and Braun vs Arrow/Braun/Vygon in the OR
- US can only access proximal part of the CVC, no information about "intrathoracal"/distal part
