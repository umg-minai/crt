# Conclusion

The incidence of CRT is much higher in surgical than in medical critical ill patients.
Depening on the type of CVC the median CRT-free time varies from one to five days.
Possible explanations may be the vascular trauma and perioperative inflammation.
In general these thrombosis are asymptomatic and don't require any treatment.
However, the difference in CVC material and the resulting CRTs are neglected in clinical research and need further investigation.
