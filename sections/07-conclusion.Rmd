# Conclusions

The incidence of CRT in the IJV is much higher in surgical than in medical critically ill patients.
Possible explanations include vascular trauma and perioperative inflammation.
These thromboses are generally asymptomatic and do not require treatment.
However, the differences in CVC material and the resulting CRTs have been neglected in clinical research and need to be further investigated.
