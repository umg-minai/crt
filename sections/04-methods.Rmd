# Material and Methods

## Study design and population

In this prospective observational single-center study, we evaluated the occurrence of CRT in critically ill patients with CVCs treated in our surgical intensive care unit (ICU)
at a university hospital during a six-month period from March to August 2022.

We enrolled all adult patients (&ge; 18 years) who required a CVC for at least 48 h.
All CVCs were placed in the operating theatre or ICU using an ultrasound-guided insertion approach and maximum barrier precautions, according to local guidelines.
Skin antisepsis was performed with octenidine dihydrochlordie, 1-propanol and 2-propanol (octeniderm colourless, Sch√ºlke & Mayr GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany).
The choice of the appropriate CVC type, site, and side was made by the clinicians performing the placement.
They were asked to complete a questionnaire documenting the manufacturer, the LOT (identification) number, the number of attempts, any complications, and their level of expertise in CVC placement.
If the patient had a blood sample taken on the day of the screening, we ordered white blood cells counts (WBCs), C-reactive peptide and D-dimer.

## Ultrasound assessment

The CVCs were scanned with ultrasound for CRT every other day, starting within 24 h of placement.
We used a linear probe with a frequency of 8-12 MHz.
All patients were examined in the supine position.
A CRT was diagnosed when an echogenic structure attached to the CVC was detected which was noncompressible and showed a pathological color Doppler.
We measured the largest dimension (height) in the short-axis and the longest dimension (length) in the long-axis view to determine the size of the thrombosis.
If the length was longer than the probe/scan window, we set the length to 60 mm.
A picture or video was taken if a thrombosis was found for the first time.
We did not look at arterial catheters or catheters for renal replacement or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy.
The ultrasound examination was always performed by one of the authors (SE)
had been trained in point-of-care ultrasound and intensive care medicine and had more than two years' experience in order to ensure consistent and high image quality.
The images and videos recorded were then reviewed by a second independent intensivist (SG) with more than seven years' experience in point-of-care ultrasound.
Neither was involved in the placement of the CVCs nor the management of the critically ill patients.
The results of these nonroutine investigations were not reported to the treating clinicians so as not to alter usual care.

## Catheter types

Due to supply constraints, controlled randomization was unfeasible and different types of CVCs from different manufacturers were used.
We observed three different types of Arrow CVCs (Teleflex Medical GmbH, Germany): the classic polyurethane CVCs with three and five lumens (7 and 9.5 French; referred to as Arrow3 and Arrow5), and the chlorhexidine acetate and silver sulfadiazine coated polyurethane catheters Arrowg+ard Blue (1^st^ generation) with four lumens (8.5 French; referred to as Arrow4).
Furthermore we observed the three-lumen Certofix protect Trio catheter (7 French; B. Braun SE, Germany), consisting of a thermoplastic polyurethane, embedded with barium sulphate as a contrast agent and an antimicrobial coating containing polyhexamethylene biguanide (Polyhexanide or PHMB, referred to as Braun3), and
the five-lumen multicath CVC (9.5 French; VYGON GmbH & Co. KG, Germany; referred to as Vygon5), made of polyurethane without any special coating.

## Outcome

The primary outcome was the time of onset of CRT for each type of CVC.
The CRT rates reported were very inhomogeneous, therefore we designed our study as an
exploratory observational study over a six-month period and did not estimate a sample size.
Secondary outcomes were (1) the difference in CRT-free time according to the type
of CVC and (2) risk factors for CRT.

## Statistical analysis

All data processing and statistical analyses were performed using R version
`r paste0(sessionInfo()$R.version[c("major", "minor")], collapse = ".")`
[@R-base].

Prior to the analyses, all laboratory values were *log* transformed to
approximate normal distributions.
The CRT-free time was modelled using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and comparisons between different CVC types were made using the Gehan-Wilcoxon test with the Peto and Peto modification for different censoring patterns as implemented in the *survival* R package [@survival-book; @R-survival].
Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios of CRT
as provided by the *survival* R package [@Cox1972; @survival-book; @R-survival].
Adjustment was done for `r s <- gsub("cvc", "CVC", gsub("dvt", "previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT)", tolower(rgcx.nms))); .cli_text("{ {s}}")`.
Additionally a lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) penalized regression for Cox proportional hazard models was applied [@Simon2011; @R-glmnet] (Supplemental Table S\@ref(tab:coxnet-cf) and Figures S\@ref(fig:coxnet-cv-plot) and S\@ref(fig:coxnet-path-plot)).
The proportional hazard assumption was tested with the chi-square
test for independence of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals and transformed time
for each covariate (Supplemental Table S\@ref(tab:pha-table) and Figure S\@ref(fig:pha-plot)).
A *p*-value less than 0.05 was considered a statistically significant difference.
The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple testing [@Benjamini1995].
Summary tables, the CONSORT and the forest plots were generated using the packages *gtsummary*, *consort*, and *survminer*, respectively
[@Sjoberg2021; @R-gtsummary; @R-consort; @R-survminer].
