# Abstract

**Purpose**:
Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) is a major complication of central venous catheters (CVCs).
However, the incidence, onset, and dependence of CRT on CVC material and/or manufacturer in critically ill surgial patients is unkown.

**Methods**:
In this prospective observational single-center study we included all critical ill patients with CVCs during a six-month period.
We did an ultrasound-based examination of the CVCs for CRT every other day, starting within 24 hours of placement.
The primary outcome was the time of onset of CRT depending on the type of CVC.

**Results**:
We screened `r nrow(cvc)` CVCs and finally included
`r sum(!cvc$isExcluded)` first-time CVCs in the internal jugular vein.
The median time to CRT
varies from `r mr <- range(median(m$svf)); wmr <- .as.word(mr); .cli_text("{ {wmr[1]}} {qty(mr[1])}day{?s} to { {wmr[2]}} {qty(mr[2])}day{?s}")` for the different type of CVCs.
`r paste0(range(round((1 - .survival(m$svf, times = 1)) * 100)), collapse = " to ")`% of CVCs developed a CRT within one day
and `r paste0(range(round((1 - .survival(m$svf, times = 7)) * 100)), collapse = " to ")`% of CVCs within one week of catheterization, respectively.
Generally, the CRT were asymptomatic and caused no complications.
Beside cancer and no prophylactic anticoagulation some CVC types were associated with a higher risk for CRT.

**Conclusion**:
Almost all CVCs in critically ill surgical patients developed an asymptomatic CRT in the first days after catheterization.
Depending on the type of CVC the median CRT-free period varies considerably.
