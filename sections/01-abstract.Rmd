# Abstract

**Study Objective**:
Catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) is a major complication of central venous catheters (CVCs).
However, the incidence, onset, and dependence of CRT on CVC material and/or type in critically ill surgical patients is unknown.
Therefore, we here investigated incidence, onset, and dependence of CRT on a variety of risk factors including CVC material and type in critically ill surgical patients.

**Design**: Prospective, investigator-initiated, observational study.

**Setting**: A surgical ICU at an university hospital.

**Patients**: All critically ill patients with CVCs (`r paste0(c("surgical", "medical"), ": ", .pct(c(mean(m$data$AdmissionType == "surgical"), mean(m$data$AdmissionType == "medical"))), collapse = "/")`)
that were treated in our surgical ICU during a six-month period.

**Interventions**: None.

**Measurements**:
All CVCs were examined for CRT every other day using ultrasound, starting within 24 hours of placement.
The primary outcome was the time of onset of CRT depending on the type of CVC
(three to five lumens, three different manufacturers).
CRT risk factors were analyzed using multiple Cox proportional hazards regression models.

**Main Results**:
We included `r sum(!cvc$isExcluded)` first-time CVCs in the internal jugular vein.
The median time to CRT
varied from `r mr <- range(median(m$svf)); wmr <- .as.word(mr); .cli_text("{ {wmr[1]}} {qty(mr[1])}day{?s} to { {wmr[2]}} {qty(mr[2])}day{?s}")` for different types of CVCs.
Within one day, `r paste0(range(round((1 - .survival(m$svf, times = 1)) * 100)), collapse = " to ")`% of CVCs
and within one week, `r paste0(range(round((1 - .survival(m$svf, times = 7)) * 100)), collapse = " to ")`% of CVCs developed a CRT.
All but one of the observed CRT were asymptomatic and caused no complications.
Multiple regression analyses of CRT risk factors showed that beside cancer and omitting prophylactic anticoagulation, also some CVC types were associated with a higher risk for CRT.

**Conclusions**:
Almost all CVCs in critically ill surgical patients developed an asymptomatic CRT in the first days after catheterization.
Depending on the type of CVC the median CRT-free period varied considerably.
